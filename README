This is a Java program with associated Perl utilities for managing my
photos.  It used to be written entirely in Perl, but then my Windows
Vista machine, upon which I ran this, totally crashed and I
re-installed it with Windows 7 (hurrah!).  However, I don't want to
install Perl on it and instead wanted to run my photograph stuff on my
mac, so I re-wrote most of the functionality in Java.  However, the
web site that shows the photos still uses Perl and I put all the EXIF
data in a Perl hash, so I still need to generate that using Perl.  I
set the timestamps using Perl merely because I know how to do it in
Perl; maybe I'll re-write that in Java someday.  All the photograph
resizing is now done in Java, and I'm free of Image::Magick at last.
